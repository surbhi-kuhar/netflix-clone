The project mentioned above is a Netflix clone since it draws inspiration from the user interface of Netflix. 
React, a javascript package used to partition the website into components, and Firebase, a back-end cloud computing service from which the data to be shown is being fetched, are the technologies utilized.
The first page that appears is the login page, where the user must provide a valid email address and a password longer than six characters in order to log in and access their home page.
